Enhancements

Geometry
~~~~~~~~

Algorithms to compute distance between LOS and a flux surfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Compute distance between LOS and a circle (*+ vectorial version*)
-  Test if a LOS and a circle are close to a epsilon (*+ vectorial
   version*)
-  Compute distance between LOS and VPoly (*+ vectorial version*)
-  Test if a LOS and a VPoly are close to a epsilon (*+ vectorial
   version*)
-  Compute which LOS is closer to a VPoly
-  Compute which VPoly is closer to a LOS

Algorithms for discretization and sampling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Optimization of discretization of 1D lines (simple + complex
   version), 2D lines, 2D polygons
-  Optimization of LOS sampling and all the different rules:
   parallelized and using less memory.

Calc signal (function integration over LOS):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  ``LOS_calc_signal`` now cythonized for isotropic and anisotropic
   emissivity and several sampling / integration strategies

Algorithms to check if visible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Optimization ``LOS_isVis_PtFromPts_VesStruct`` checks if a point is
   visible with respect to a list of points and taking into account a
   vessel (with structures, limits, etc.) : function cythonized
   properly, speed up ~50%
-  ``LOS_areVis_PtsFromPts_VesStruct`` equivalent to last function but
   input is a list of points
-  ``Dust_calc_SolidAngle`` is now using new versions of above mentioned
   functions

Vignetting
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Added functions to compute the 3d bounding box of a polygon in 3d
   space
-  Added functions for the triangulation of a polygon by earclipping
-  Added function that tests if intersection between ray and triangle in
   space
-  Added functions for vignetting : for a set of rays and a sets of
   polygons, test if the rays go through the polygons or not.

Structures and Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  ``tf.geom.Struct._get_phithetaproj()``: to get the (phi, theta)
   limits in a project of each toroidal occurence of Struct, with
   respect to a refpt in (R,Z)
-  ``tf.geom.Struct._get_phithetaproj_dist()``: + get the distance
-  ``tf.geom.dist._get_phithetaproj_dist()``: generalize to all Struct
   of a Config
-  Config has set\_colors\_random()

Solid angles
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Added ``_GG.Dust_calc_SolidAngle`` for computation of a solid angle
   on dust particle (multi-pos, multi-pts, with and without vect, with
   and without approx, with and without block)

Basic Reflexions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Rays subclasses can now have added reflections
   (self.add\_reflections())
-  Reflections can alos be extracted (instead of stored) as a list of
   separated cameras using Rays.get\_reflections\_as\_cam()
-  Reflections can be of type 'specular', 'diffusive' or 'ccube'
-  The reflection type can be forced by the user (identical for all LOS
   of a camera) or automatically set by the Structural elements each LOS
   touches
-  There can be any number of reflections
-  Rays.plot() and Rays.plot\_touch() have been updated to properly
   represent reflections
-  Rays.calc\_signal() and Rays.calc\_signal\_from\_Plasma2D() have been
   updated to account for reflections with a user-provided coefficient

Cythonization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Re wrote some numpy function to avoid over heading: hypothenus and
   composition of minimum of hypotenus, minimum of vector, tile,

Extra
^^^^^

-  Erased *old* functions:

   -  ``SLOW_LOS_Calc_PInOut_VesStruct``
   -  ``Calc_LOS_PInOut_Lin``
   -  ``Calc_LOS_PInOut_Tor``

-  extract\_svd() now compatible with Py27 and Py36
-  Rays.dgeom['indout'][0,:] now refers to the global index of each
   structure (as in config.lStruct)
-  Operator overloading of \_\_\_\_repr\_\_\_\_ of all tofu objects with
   attribute get\_summary()

Cameras and visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  overloaded **add** operator to allow for easy CamLOS1D concatenation
-  ``tf.geom.dist.plot_phithetaproj_dist()``: plot a static figure with
   a place holder for time traces, the (phi,theta) projection (with
   aspect ratio), the cross and hor Config projections and legend
-  ``Rays.plot_touch()`` now handles: angles (wrote docstring)

General
~~~~~~~

-  get\_summary() is now a method of the AbstractToFuObject parent
   class, implemented for Config, CamLOS1D, Plasma2D
-  saving to .mat file is now more robust (operational)
-  Added benchmarking for ``calc_signal``

IMAS interfacing
----------------

1. libraries that need imas2tofu are only imported if the **IMAS**
   module is found (Warning not Error)

2. **MultiIDSLoader** class now handles all imas interfacing:

-  allows for loading several ids from different idd
-  dynamic printing of ids loading
-  get\_summary() methods giving an overview of content
-  provides a dictionary of shortcuts for fast typing of pre-recorded
   imas signals
-  provides dictionary of preset ids and signals
-  Flexible instanciation, from idd of idd args, ids or ids args, open
   or not, get or not
-  provides add\_idd(), remove\_idd(), add\_ids(), remove\_ids()
-  Include to\_Config(), to\_Plasma2D(), to\_Diag() to export to tofu
   objects

3. \*\*All stored in a single \_core.py\*\*:

-  MultiIDSLoader
-  load\_Config(), load\_Plasma2D(), load\_Diag()

4. **save\_to\_imas()**

-  Actual routines implemented in tf.imas2tofu.\_core
-  methods implemented for Struct, Config, CamLOS1D

5. Other

-  MultiIDSLoader now has calc\_signal()
-  ids = 'magfieldlines' returns mag field line tracking from IMAS
   equilibrium
-  More robust / detailed sanity checks of triangular meshes from IMAS
-  Synthetic data and experimental data are now time-synchronized
-  Synthetic diag operational on WEST for interferometer, polarimeter,
   bremsstrahlung and bolometers

bash interface:
---------------

-  tofuplot debugged
-  tofucalc created

Code structure and format
-------------------------

Restructuring of the geometry modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Created cython include files ``*.pxd`` and ``*.pyx`` for the following
group of functions: - ``_basic_geom_tools.*``: global variables
definition (``_VSMALL`` and ``_SMALL``), and basic geometric tools
(vector calculus, path distance point-point, point-vector,...) -
``_raytracing_tools.*``: for intersection of LOS and different objects
(bounding boxes, poly, surfaces, ...) - ``_distance_tools.*``: distance
between LOS and circle, VPoly and so on - ``_sampling_tools.*``: line,
LOS, poly, volume, and surface sampling

Installation and portability
----------------------------

-  Had to use some cpp tools, so had to update the ``setup.py``
-  Updated the ``setup.py`` to be able to "clean" an installation (erase
   compilation files)
-  Took out the possibility of not using cython, as this is now
   impossible
-  git dependency is now optional (issue #67 )
-  changes in ``setup.py`` for **Windows** portability
-  Now only supporting ``cython`` versions ``>=0.26``
-  Removed all **pandas** dependencies
-  Using ``-O3`` flag instead of ``-O0`` for faster execution time even
   if compilation is slower
-  Removed all **Polygon** dependencies

Unit test
---------

-  Added unit tests for triangulations, and vignetting
-  Added unit test for computation of kmin, kmax
   ``LOS_Calc_kMinkMax_VesStruct``
-  Update of ``in _vessel`` tests
-  Added tests for ``is_visble`` (vectorized and point wise)
-  Now by default ``python setup.py nosetests`` with run with: verbose,
   detailed erorrs, coverage (nose) and other utilities for debugging.
   But most importantly **only tests in ``tofu/tofu/tests/`` will be
   run**.
-  Testing all get\_sample options in a short new unit test
-  Testing all options for LOS\_calc\_signal (method of discretization,
   of integration, steps relative, absolute, unique or changing for each
   los, etc.).

Update of documentation
-----------------------

-  Added documentation on how to install on Windows
-  Updated, restructured and adde figures to README. Change of format
   ``*.rst`` to ``*.md``
-  Updated Wiki pages on GitHub

Bugs
----

-  Found several small bugs in the function that computes for a list of
   flux surfaces and a list of rays the kmin, kmax
-  There was a bug in some special cases of 1D camera definition, when
   all Ds are on a similar plane sharing the same D for the 2 first LOS,
   solved
-  There was a bug in tf.data.\ *plot*\ combine() (wrong graph), solved
   (issue #65 )
-  There was another bug with plot\_combine() when several equilibria
   were provided, the reference time was not properly defined
   (short-term fix, on the long term issue #79 should fix it)
