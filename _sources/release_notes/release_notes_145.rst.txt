Detailed changes:
=================

Installation / portability:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- default config txt files are now included in sdist #378
- License is now included in sdist (preparing for conda-forge) #388

scripts:
~~~~~~~~
- bash command tofu-version return version of currently installed tofu without
  loading tofu itself (read tofu/version.py, faster) #390
- More robust tofucalc and tofuplot, with less warnings #393

Geometry:
~~~~~~~~~
- New **DEMO 2019 configuration** available! #391
- New **TOMAS configuration** available! #391

IMAS interfacing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- imas2tofu now provides tools for inspecting units from the dd_units tool
  Consequently it checks units when multi.calc_signal() is called to determine
  if a 4pi factor is necessary.
  Also, a user-provided corrective coefficient can be used.
  Also, time limts can be passed and events is usable as ids in tofuplot
  Also, events can be passed as time limits
  Also, a function provides a comparison between tofu and IMAS units #380
