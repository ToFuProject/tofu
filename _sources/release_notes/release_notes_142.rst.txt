Detailed changes:
=================

Installation / portability:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Bug fixes for installation on ITER and Gateway clusters #250
- Easier installation on Mac #183 (``requirements.txt``)
- Removed explicit compiler specification in ``setup.py`` for more flexibility
- When sub-packages imas2tofu or mag are missing, the warning is much more concise, but the error traceback is still accessible in a hidden dictionnary for developpers #243
- ``python setup.py clean`` now doesn't cythonize
- Dropped python 2 support: #228
  - merged ``_GG02`` and ``_GG03`` into the ``_GG`` file
  - no longer being tested in travis
  - no longer packaged in conda
  - updated README file accordingly
  - dropped ``funcsigs`` dependency
  - made necessary changes in ``setup.py``
  - ``benchmarks/calc_signal_benchmark.py``: now working with python 3

Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Major bug fix in ``LOS_calc_signal()`` for computing the synthetic signal of a LOS camera using a particular algortihm : method='sum', minimize='hybrid', ani=True,  #247 #255
- Major bug fix in ``LOS_get_sample()`` when ``minimize='hybrid'`` and ``minimize='memory'`` the limits were not set correctly
  in some cases the formula for sampling a LOS was wrong (``los_get_sample_core_var_res``).
- Minor bug fixes in interactive figures when ``t=None`` was used (the interactivity was lost due to wrong formatting of the time array)
- Minor bug fixed in Plasma 2D interpolation (``interp_t`` was not being set), imporved error messages #209
- Removed unused variable in ``_Ves_get_sampleS`` (_GG), in ``_core.py`` #190
- Gave more explicit names to some variables in ``_core.py`` to avoid bugs/typos (eg. ``I`` to ``current``) #186
- Removed a secondary ``init`` function for the class ``tf.geom.CoilsPF`` #187
- ``_checkformat_inputs_dgeom`` now is a function of ``Rays`` class
- Change default separator in ``to_dict()`` from '_' to '.', #228
- Rays.calc_kInOut_IsoFlux() is now more flexible (accepts 3d np.arrays as well as lists of np.ndarrays), #188
- __repr__() is now overloaded in a more robust way so it falls back to printing the class if get_summary() fails to avoid crashing in debug mode #242
- Minor bug in time interpolation in Plasma2D methods #215


Documentation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Updated information about support of python version #273
- Added slides of talk given at PyConFR 2019 conference
- Added a **gallery** in our documentation with 3 different tutorials:
  - 5 minutes tutorial to show to create a geometry and 1D/2D cameras
  - Guide on how to create your own Geometry from scratch (vacuum vessel, structures, etc.)
  - How to compute the signal received by a camera using a synthetic signal.
  For all of these tutorial, you can see directly the codes and the
  resulting images, and you can get the source code or download it as a
  Jupyter notebook!
- Minor changes to the web doc: updated install instructions to be "cleaner"
  now in rST and not HTML), small changes in navigation bar.
- Guide on how to contribute to ToFu.

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- First version of **magnetic field line tracing** (for WEST only so far, to be improved) #213 #235
- First version of **2D XRay Bragg spectrometers** for synthetic diagnostics, modelling the diagnotics geometry and providing 2d spectral fitting routines (to be improved) #267
- When computing a signal ``LOS_calc_signal`` emissivity function can now return
  a 1D array if ``t=None`` #217 #252
- Three functions added to ``tf.geom.Rays``: #211
	- ``calc_length_in_isoflux()``: compute the length inside a set of isoflux surfaces of each LOS
	- ``calc_min_geom_radius()``: compute the minimal geometrical radius (impact parameter) of each LOS
	- ``calc_min_rho_from_Plasma2D()``: compute the minimum normalized radius (or any field with a minimum on the axis) for each LOS
- New **ITER configuration** available! #220 #227
- New **JET configuration** available! #282
- imas2tofu now more robust with respect to one-time-step only data fields and can handle basic rectangular meshes in addition to triangular meshes #218, #280
- More explicit names for default configurations #264
- The github homepage now includes a badge to the gitter chatroom #277
