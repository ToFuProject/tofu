Detailed changes:
=================


Tokamak geometries:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- AUG: added a simple one-polygon version #606
- SPARC: added 2 versions #598
- NSTX: added a very detailed version #615

CrystalBragg class:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Cryst.get_plasmadomain_at_lamb() which plots the plasma domain from which a wavelength is accessible to a detector #591
- Cryst.calc_signal_from_emissivity() which plots the synthetic signal from a user-provided plasma emissivity map and spectrum #601
- tofu.spectro has new routines for 2d spectra fitting and plotting (fit2d(), plot_dinput2d(), plot_fit2d()) #611
- Cryst.plot() can now take any pts for ray-tracing, not only from the plasma (also from the detector) #616
- Cryst.compute_rocking_curve() implemented, with plots #623
- Cryst.compute_rocking_curve() works with default args #625
- Cryst.compute_rocking_curve() takes non-parallelism #627

Fit2d:
~~~~~~
- Saturation of amplitudes is fixed by allowing zero amplitude #624
- Added extraction of phi from magaxis + amp_on_bck_thresh #628

Plasma2D:
~~~~~~~~~
- Debuggued plasma2d interpolation for triangular meshes #633

IMAS interfacing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added ids summary #622
- Added more shortcuts for ids summary #625

Unit tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed a rounding error in the cython part that was breaking unit tests #619
- Reactivated complete testing matrix #620

CI, packaging and doc:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- svg.path is a new dependency #583
- Support for python 3.9 (python 3.6 removed) #584
- scikit-sparse and scikit-umfpack are optional dependencies #585
- Removed temporary latex files from notes #587
- C++ dependency removed to avoid a bug (and to avoid a dependency) #590

Benchmarks:
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Benchmark suite has been completed with structure sampling and 1d spectral fitting #589

Miscellaneous:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Figures interactivity had been lost, it is recovered #594
- Documentation is updated #609
